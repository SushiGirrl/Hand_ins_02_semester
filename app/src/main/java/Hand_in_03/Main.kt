    Write a program that takes a list of words as input and prints the frequency of each word.
    Hint: Use a MutableMap
    val words = listOf("apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple","banana", "apple", "orange", "banana","banana", "apple", "orange", "apple", "orange", "banana")
